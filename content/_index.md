# Introduction

Welcome to [Bioinf XYZ](https://bioinf.xyz), a website with DIY (Do It Yourself) tutorials and educational material for bioinformatics! This website is aimed to nerds, those curious of the world of biological coding and privacy-aware who rather analyse data themselves than let a third party company analyse the data on one's behalf.

## About the author

My name is Kasper and I come from an extensive computer science background. In 2021 I decided to embark on a small journey to expand my knowledge beyond just computer science, and started studying at the Master of Bioinformatics programme of KU Leuven in Belgium. After completion of my studies I started working on bioinformatics related projects on my free time. On this website, I will share tutorials and educational material related to the bioinformatics projects I have worked on. Hopefully they will help you to learn something new.

## First tutorial...

The first tutorial involves the sequencing and analysis of your **own genome**. Start reading it [here]({{< ref "/docs/your-own-genome" >}}).
